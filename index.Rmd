# Welcome {-}

## A Sample Course {-}

Please email me for access to a private Github repository with course materials such as a syllabus, course schedule, and assignments.

You will notice that some of the exercise questions are unusually specific. For example, they will ask the student to assign the answer in a certain form to a variable with a very specific name. This is because they are written with automatic grading in mind. All of exercises have been very generously "battle tested" by the Fall 2021 STAT 5430 class at the University of Virginia. R scripts were graded with the `gradeR` package [@gradeR], and Python scripts with the [`Otter-Grader` library](https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [@otter].
